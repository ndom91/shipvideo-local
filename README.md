# shipvideo

Paste a URL or a prompt, get a 20 to 40 second launch video. No video model:
Opus 5.5 writes a single HTML film and a serverless agent on OpenComputer
renders it frame by frame in headless Chromium, encodes it with ffmpeg, and
uploads the MP4 to Vercel Blob. Same mechanism as the "Opus 5.5 is incredible
at instructional video generation" demo (Opus wrote JS, rendered via a headless
browser + ffmpeg), packaged behind a one-field form.

```
opencomputer/   the OpenComputer project (one agent, `director`, model anthropic/claude-opus-5.5)
oc-template.toml  one-click deploy manifest
web/            Next.js app: the form, two API routes, Vercel Blob for storage
```

## Deploy the agent to your own OpenComputer account

One click: https://app.opencomputer.dev/new?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdiggerhq%2Fshipvideo

Or from a terminal:

```
npx opencomputer template deploy https://github.com/diggerhq/shipvideo
```

The agent works on its own in the playground or the CLI (it keeps the MP4 in
the runtime and tells you the path). The `web/` frontend adds the form and the
upload to Vercel Blob.

## How a job flows

1. `POST /api/jobs` validates the input, mints a job id, generates a Vercel Blob
   client token scoped to `videos/<jobId>.mp4` (3 h, video/mp4 only), creates an
   OpenComputer session, waits for `runtime.connected`, and sends one turn whose
   text is a `JOB` block (mode, input, upload pathname, upload token).
2. The agent (url mode) fetches the page with `web_fetch`, which also extracts
   title, description, headings, the most used hex colors, and Google Fonts.
3. It writes the film as one HTML document (1920x1080, CSS keyframes or a
   rAF loop), runs `check_scene` (loads it under the virtual clock, reports JS
   errors and the visible text at several timestamps), fixes, then calls
   `render_video`.
4. `render_video` renders every frame with Playwright's arm64 headless shell
   under an injected virtual clock (rAF, timers, Date, and CSS/WAAPI animations
   are all driven by `__seek(t)`), pipes JPEG frames into a static ffmpeg
   (libx264, crf 18, yuv420p, faststart), and uploads with `@vercel/blob/client`.
5. `GET /api/jobs/<id>?session=<sid>` reads the session's events to derive a
   phase, and reports `done` as soon as `head(videos/<id>.mp4)` finds the blob.

The runtime is a fresh Amazon Linux 2023 arm64 microVM per session (node 22,
dnf, no browser), so the first tool call installs playwright-core, ffmpeg-static,
@vercel/blob, the Chromium shared libs, and Noto fonts into ~/workspace/renderer
(about a minute). Rendering runs at roughly real time: a 30 s film takes 30-40 s.

## Run it

```
npm install && npx opencomputer link --create-project shipvideo && npx opencomputer deploy --watch
cd web && npm install && vercel link && vercel env pull .env.local
# add to web/.env.local: OPENCOMPUTER_API_KEY=... and OC_AGENT_ID=shipvideo@development
npx opencomputer env set BLOB_PUBLIC_BASE --value-stdin   # https://<store>.public.blob.vercel-storage.com
cd web && npm run dev
```

The web app needs a Vercel Blob store connected to the project (public access)
so `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` lands in the env. Nothing else is required: the agent
has no secrets, the only credential it ever sees is the per-job upload token.

## Gotchas

- Turns carry a plain string (`POST /sessions/:id/turns {input}`), so the job
  fields ride in the prompt text and the model copies them into `render_video`.
- No `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<iframe>`, CSS transitions, `Math.random`, or
  external images in a scene; the tools reject the first three and the prompt
  forbids the rest so renders stay deterministic.
- `@sparticuz/chromium` does not ship arm64 builds; Playwright's
  `chromium-headless-shell` does, and needs the dnf libs listed in
  `opencomputer/agents/director/tools/renderer.ts`.
